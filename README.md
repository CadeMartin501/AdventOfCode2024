This is a collection of my attempts at Advent of Code 2024 and learning Python 
by using this event to do so! A lot of my attempts are brute force attempts,
as I do not know any of the quick shortcuts that Python has available, but I
will be trying to learn those as I attempt the days! - Cade Martin, OBU 2026
